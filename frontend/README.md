# Guess.io

## Description

**Guess.io** is a word-based guessing game. In this game, the user can enter as many words as they wish, and for each word, the system calculates a "ratio" to determine how far or close they are to the randomly selected winning word. The range for this ratio is from 0 to 1000, where a higher score indicates a closer guess.
